=== freetype-2.3.5.p2 (David Kirkby, January 2nd 2010) ===
 * #7138 Ensure -m64 gets added on all platforms, not just OS X
   A better fix will be to remove all the hard-coded -m64 junk
   and replace by an environment variable CFLAG64, but until
   sage-env is updated, that will not work, so I've just left it
   as it has always been, but now working on all platforms if the
   compiler is gcc.
