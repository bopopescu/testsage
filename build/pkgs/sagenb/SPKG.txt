   * The patch queue is clear.
   * The notebook runs.
   * The doctests pass: sage -t -sagenb
   * Test for ability to install without internet connection.
     Any dependencies that must be downloaded can be added in ./spkg-dist and inserted
     in setup.py. Dependencies of dependencies need not be put in setup.py, but
     need to be put in ./spkg-dist.
   * The Selenium tests pass (optional, for now).
   * The localization file ``sagenb.pot`` is up-to-date .
      * Run ``pybabel extract -F /path/to/babel.cfg /path/to/project
        -o /path/to/sagenb.po`` (get pybabel with ``easy_install
        pybabel``).
      * Copy the headers from the existing ``sagenb.pot``.
      * Replace ``sagenb.pot`` with ``sagenb.po``.

   Then,

   * Update the version in setup.py and commit this change.
   * Run spkg-dist.
   * Install and test the new spkg: sage -f dist/sagenb-*.spkg

   Contact a maintainer about pushing updates to the public Mercurial
   repository.

 * Stylesheets (CSS): see sass/readme.txt.

 * To add a locale to an existing install:

   * Create a new locale, or download one from
     `http://wiki.sagemath.org/i18n`_:

      * To create a new locale:

        * Edit and save a copy of ``sagenb.pot``
          using your favorite text editor or POEdit (http://poedit.net)

        * (Recommended) Post the new locale to
          `http://wiki.sagemath.org/i18n`_

   * Compile your copy via ``msgfmt sagenb.pot -o sagenb.mo``

   * Copy ``sagenb.mo`` to ``sagenb/locale/xx_YY/LC_MESSAGES/``,
     where xx_YY is a locale code (en_US, pt_BR, en_UK, etc.)
