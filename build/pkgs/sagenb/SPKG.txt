== Special Update / Build Instructions ==

Warning: I have tried to update this section but it might still have
anachronistic information in it.

 * To release a new spkg, go to your sagenb repository and check that:

   * All changes are committed.
   * .gitignore and MANIFEST.in are current.
   * The notebook runs.
   * The doctests pass: sage -t --sagenb
   * The notebook will be possible to install from the new SPKG without an
     internet connection.
       * Any dependencies that must be downloaded can be added in depdist.sh
         and inserted in setup.py. Dependencies of dependencies need not be put
         in setup.py, but need to be put in depdist.sh (until we can make it
         smarter).
   * The Selenium tests pass (optional, for now).
   * The localization file ``sagenb.pot`` is up-to-date .
       * Run ``pybabel extract -F /path/to/babel.cfg /path/to/project
         -o /path/to/sagenb.po`` (get pybabel with ``easy_install
         pybabel``).
       * Copy the headers from the existing ``sagenb.pot``.
       * Replace ``sagenb.pot`` with ``sagenb.po``.

   Then,

   * Update the version in setup.py and commit this change.
   * Run depdist.sh
   * Copy the newly generated dist/ directory from the sagenb repo to the
     SPKG's root directory and rename it src/ , replacing the src/ directory
     that is currently there
   * Pack up the SPKG with `sage --pkg --no-compress` (because everything in
     src/ is already compressed)
   * Install and test the new spkg: sage -f sagenb-*.spkg
   * Don't forget to push all changes in the sagenb repo to github.

 * Stylesheets (CSS): see sass/readme.txt.

 * To add a locale to an existing install:

   * Create a new locale, or download one from
     `http://wiki.sagemath.org/i18n`_:

      * To create a new locale:

        * Edit and save a copy of ``sagenb.pot``
          using your favorite text editor or POEdit (http://poedit.net)

        * (Recommended) Post the new locale to
          `http://wiki.sagemath.org/i18n`_

   * Compile your copy via ``msgfmt sagenb.pot -o sagenb.mo``

   * Copy ``sagenb.mo`` to ``sagenb/locale/xx_YY/LC_MESSAGES/``,
     where xx_YY is a locale code (en_US, pt_BR, en_UK, etc.)

== Changelog ==

 * For an accurate log of changes, run `git log` in the sagenb repository.
