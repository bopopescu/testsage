Description: Conductor and Reduction Types for Genus 2 Curves
 Let C be a proper smooth curve of genus 2 defined by a hyperelliptic
 equation
 .
                         y^2+Q(x)y=P(x)
 .
 where P(x) and Q(x) are polynomials with rational coefficients such
 that deg(Q(x))<4, deg(P(x))<7.
 .
 Let J(C) be the Jacobian of C, let X be the minimal regular model of
 C over the ring of integers Z.
 .
 This program determines the reduction of C at any prime number p (that
 is the special fiber X_p of X over p), and the exponent f of the conductor
 of J(C) at p.
 .
 Unfortunately, this program is not yet complete for p=2.
