== Changelog ==

===  (William Stein, January 23rd, 2009) ===
 -- created proper SPKG.txt
 -- fixed bug in pexpect where it tried to run directories

== NOTES ==

NOTE -- pexpect-2.1 is shockingly slow for SAGE (especially in the notebook)
        and I can't figure out why.  So we're sticking with pexpect-2.0
        for now (which works fine for us).

 -- put a try/except around __del__, to get rid of lots of pointless
    warning messages.
